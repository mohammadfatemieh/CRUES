This project aims to develop co-operative robots which effectively map and 
search an area using non-telemetric communication. This will allow the
robotic systems to perform even in environments which hinder telemetry, such as
caves or tunnels. Each of these systems should be able to solve this problem 
individually; however, after the introduction of multiple robots to the area,
they should be able to distribute the task to solve it quicker. The robots will
be tested in a custom-made modular testing maze environment, in which a target
is to be located, and their performance evaluated both individually and
co-operatively. Detailed analysis of the electrical, software and mechanical design 
solutions made is presented. The robots use computer vision software in 
conjunction with ultrasonic sensors to perceive the environment and identify
other robots in the group, and incremental encoders and an inertial measurement
unit are used to track the robots position and orientation. Communication
is conducted over ad-hoc Wi-Fi, which is artificially restricted to require 
line-of-sight between robots, so as to simulate situations where global
communication is not possible. The report also contains extensive discussion of
the project management approach used to properly coordinate the project team. The 
structure of the team and practices employed have been considered carefully and a 
detailed timeline was developed to minimise potential risk. Each individual
component was tested in isolation, before being integrated. Despite
not all of the objectives being accomplished, the project can be deemed 
successful. Unforeseen delays and technical difficulties delayed the completion
of some latter objectives which has resulted in the AI module not being integrated. 
However, the system implemented was to a high standard, with its modularity
meaning it could easily be continued in the future.
