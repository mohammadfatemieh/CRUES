This project aimed to develop co-operative robots which effectively map and 
search an area using non-telemetric communication. This will allow the
robotic systems to perform even in environments which hinder telemetry, such as
caves or tunnels. Each of these systems should be able to solve this problem 
individually; however, after the introduction of multiple robots to the area,
they should be able to distribute the task to solve it quicker. The robots will
be tested in a custom-made modular testing maze environment, in which a target
is to be located, and their performance evaluated both individually and
co-operatively. Detailed analysis of the electrical, software and mechanical design 
solutions made is presented. The robots use incremental encoders and an inertial measurement
unit are used to track the robots position and orientation as it moves through its environment. Computer vision software in 
conjunction with ultrasonic sensors to perceive the environment, identify
other robots and produce a map of the area. Communication
is conducted over ad-hoc Wi-Fi, which is artificially restricted to require 
line-of-sight between robots, so as to simulate situations where global
communication is not possible. The report also contains extensive discussion of
the project management approach and practices employed used to properly coordinate the project team and minimise potential risk. The rigorous testing process of each subsystem in isolation, before higher level system testing is also described. 

Unforeseen setbacks and technical difficulties delayed the completion
of some latter objectives which has resulted in the AI module not being fully integrated. The system  was, however, implemented to a high standard, and its modularity would allow it could easily be continued in the future.
