\chapter{Electrical And Mechanical}\label{electrical}

\section{Chassis}\label{mech/chassis}
The mechanical design of each robot is central to its 
functionality with several of the sensors
reliant on the accuracy of the mechanical construction. As 
multiple robots are being built, 
their mechanical similarity is important to guarantee the 
sensors and software function consistently across each robot. 
Given this consideration, Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) are used in 
the final iteration of the design---with strip board being used for 
prototyping---as this will provide additional robustness and 
guaranteed repeatability between robots.

The chassis used for the robots was the pre-built ``hobbyist'' 
chassis from Pololu~\cite{pololuchassis}. These chassis were 
chosen as they ensured manufacturing consistency and allowed 
for scalability, due to their availability, both of which were 
essential design considerations. The chassis were accompanied by 
a number of fitted parts which were also used such as motors, 
encoders and a power distribution and motor drive board. Using these pre-built 
solutions reduced the number of parts which had to be created 
and fitted, simplifying the construction process.
The chassis had numerous mounting holes, which again eased 
construction, as holes did not need to be drilled in the chassis 
to mount the PCB and other components. A variety of chassis 
colours were also used to simplify the robot recognition which 
was required and will be discussed later in Section~\ref{soft/cv}. 

During integration testing, issues were encountered with some of the motors, 
as it was noticed that they 
were leaking oil or grease from their plastic casing. This 
resulted in the gears making more noise than they did previously 
and resulted in motor failure when the motors were run for a 
prolonged period of time without more grease. This was 
investigated through the manufacturer, however, unfortunately no 
reply has been forthcoming. The risk of motor failure was 
reduced by applying a more appropriate grease at the 
recommendation of S. Cartwright, the lab technician.  

To robustly connect each of the components to the 
chassis, plastic spacers were used. To obtain the required size 
of 23mm between the chassis and PCB 
and between the PCB and the RPi, spacers of 8mm and 15mm 
were attached using an M3 screw. For the M3 screw to also 
be used to connect the relevant parts, the standard mounting holes 
on the RPi had to be widened slightly. The M3 screws were 
then used to attach the chassis to the PCB and the PCB to the 
RPi. The 23mm size was determined using the standard 
header size which would be between both sets of components in 
addition to allowing for a small gap between the header and the 
component above. This additional space allowed for airflow which 
aided in component cooling. 

The spacers also allow components to be placed above each other 
and above the centre of the robot. Maintaining the centre of 
gravity close to the centre of the robot, and therefore reducing 
interference of centripetal forces around the centre of the robot, 
is vital for the accuracy of the IMU (see Section~\ref{elec/imu/impl}). By using 
the spacers to maintain a centre of gravity above the centre of the 
robot, the general balance of the robot was also aided and the drive 
control of the robot was made simpler.  

\subsection{Drive System}\label{mech/chassis/drive}

The drive system for the robots will be a differential drive system (DDR).
This drives each wheel independently using independent actuators and the
wheels are not connected by a single axle~\cite[p.~146]{braunl_embedded_2013}.
When using a two wheeled robot, DDR allows the
robot to rotate on the spot around its central axis when the wheels 
are driven in opposite directions. This provides a high level of 
mobility which will aid in the sensing and mapping capabilities of 
the robot. This also allows the corridors of the maze to be narrower 
than otherwise, allowing more complex mazes to be formed. The 
chassis chosen is accompanied by a motor and encoder for each wheel 
which can be used to obtain data for wheel odometry. 
  

\section{Power Distribution and Motor Drive}\label{elec/poweranddrive}
The Pololu Power Distribution and Motor Drive board~\cite{pololupower}
was selected for power distribution across
the robot. This board is the main accompanying part for the Romi
chassis chosen and, in addition to power distribution, also provides
two Texas Instruments DRV8838~\cite{texasdrivers} motor drivers to control
the motors. The board integrates with the chassis easily
and regulates the voltage provided by the 6 AA batteries, using an
MP4223H switching buck converter~\cite{mpbuck}, to \SI{5}{\volt} or
\SI{3.3}{\volt} at a maximum of \SI{2.5}{\ampere}. This can be used
to power the microcontroller and peripherals used by the robot, with the
motors being supplied with the reverse protected voltage before regulation.

The board was also configurable if required, allowing the supply to be
divided into nominal \SI{6}{\volt} and \SI{3}{\volt} supplies. There are also a number of further jumper
connections on the board which can be cut for further voltage customisation.

The DRV8838 Motor Driver takes two inputs for each motor for direction and Pulse
Width Modulation (PWM), which allows the motor speed to be controlled. The
driver also has a sleep input which can be used to coast the motors if
required. Each of the motors' respective sleep inputs
and are connected by default and therefore should not be driven at the same time,
as this could result in a short circuit within the motor driver, however the
jumper connection between these can be cut to allow the sleep inputs to
be driven separately.

The power board also provides a power button and switch to control the
power supply. A separate board with only power distribution was
available, however, for the additional small cost, integration of
motor drivers was deemed to be a cost effective addition given our
space and time limitations.

The boards were soldered to the battery contacts and headers soldered
onto the boards as the robots were assembled. Once soldered, the power
distribution and motor driver board was continuity tested and continually monitored to ensure correct functionality.

\section{Range Sensors}\label{elec/range}
For the robot to localise itself, it needs to be able to measure the
distance between itself and the surrounding environment. By recording
the measurements relative to the robot's current position, a point map
can be built up over time and a general map of the environment can be
constructed.

\subsection{Design}\label{elec/range/design}
Infrared (IR), ultrasound and LIDAR distance sensors were all considered. These
are all active sensors, meaning that they measure the effect of an
output from the sensor, in these cases, IR light, ultrasonic waves
and visible light respectively.

Of these three, LIDAR is generally considered to be the most effective
as it is the most accurate and has a \ang{360} field of view. However,
it is both too expensive and too heavy for the applications of this project, especially
considering scalability requirements.

IR transceivers are far more affordable but have a limited cone of
vision per sensor as light deviates very little through air and the
maximum range of these sensors is approximately \SI{0.5}{\m}~\cite{InfraredDatasheet}.
Ultrasonic transceivers have a wider cone of
detection and also a large range~\cite{HCSR04datasheet}. In addition to
this, they are also cheaper than both IR and LIDAR systems.

Ultrasonic transceivers work by emitting sound at a particular frequency
and measuring the time until the reflected wave returns to the sensor.
Multiple ultrasonic sensors of the same design have a significant chance to interfere with each other,
however, IR also has this limitation
while also being more susceptible to external interference. A possible solution
was to make a budget LIDAR unit using a single IR sensor and a
servo motor mounted on top of the robot. This was, however, dismissed as
the two PWM pins of the RPi would be assigned to each of the
motors respectively. This solution would also require a budget and
software implementation commitment prior to testing which was not deemed
worth the potential added risk to the project.

Hence ultrasonic sensors were chosen and the ultrasonic sensor used was
the HC-SR04~\cite{HCSR04datasheet}, as previously mentioned in Section~\ref{mech/sensors}. This sensor has a range of up to \SI{4}{\m} and
ranging accuracy of up to \SI{3}{\mm}. A small dead-band exists in its
range at $<$~\SI{30}{\mm}, however mitigation of this is discussed in Section~\ref{mech/sensors}. 

The sensor is also widely used and available within the
department, mitigating any risks surrounding delivery lead times.

\subsection{Implementation}\label{elec/range/impl}
The hardware required for the ultrasonic sensors chosen is relatively straightforward.
They are each connected to a \SI{5}{\volt} supply and ground, and the other two pins are
connected to standard GPIO pins on the RPi. The echo pin has to be connected through
a voltage divider as the RPi is only rated at \SI{3.3}{\volt} compared to the sensor's \SI{5}{\volt}. The
trig pin can be connected directly to the RPi, however, as \SI{3.3}{\volt} was found to be above
the threshold voltage.

The distances are measured by a class named \verb|USScan|. This has a
\verb|get_scan()| function which iterates through each ultrasonic sensor and takes a reading,
as shown below in Listing~\ref{lst:get_scan}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={get\_scan() Function in USScan},label={lst:get_scan} , language=python]
def get_scan():
    """Get scan of ranges from all ultrasonic sensors.
    :return: (USScan) Scan of ranges
    :except: (UltrasonicTimeout) If module timed out waiting for GPIO input change
    """
    start = time.time()
    rl = get_range(LEFT)
    time_remaining = start + scan_increment - time.time()
    if time_remaining > 0:
        time.sleep(time_remaining)
    rc = get_range(CENTRE)
    time_remaining = start + 2 * scan_increment - time.time()
    if time_remaining > 0:
        time.sleep(time_remaining)
    rr = get_range(RIGHT)
    return USScan([rl, rc, rr])
\end{lstlisting}

This method allows the various readings to be taken without interfering with
each other, as the second ultrasonic pulse isn't emitted until the first is received.

As Listing~\ref{lst:get_scan} shows, \verb|get_range()| is used by
\verb|get_scan()| to find the distance measured by each sensor.
This simply triggers the sensor and times how long until the echo
pin turns high. The range is then calculated by the equation
$ 2d = tv_s$, where $v_s$ is the speed of sound.

\subsection{Testing}\label{elec/range/test}
The sensors were initially tested using a signal generator and an
oscilloscope. An object was then placed in front of the sensors
and moved away. The expected output of this test was a linear increase
in the pulse width on the echo pin as the distance
increased. This test allowed two malfunctioning sensors to be quickly identified. The pulse width could then be used to
calculate the measured distance and this compared to the distance
found with a measuring tape. This found approximately correct answers,
however the precision with which we could measure the pulse width was
not great enough for complete testing.

The wave forms produced are shown in Figure~\ref{UltrasoundWaveform}. This shows the shorter echo pulse following the fall of the wider
square wave on the trig pin, produced by the signal generator.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{graphs/UltrasonicResponseGraph.jpg}
	\caption{Ultrasound response waveform}\label{UltrasoundWaveform}

\end{figure}

A circuit was then created to read the values using an Arduino
microcontroller to allow the distance readings to be found quickly
and the accuracy of the sensors measured. The readings from this were
found to be approximately accurate (to within a half a \si{\cm},
as measured with a tape measure), although rigorous testing was not
performed as the accuracy would be dependent on the temperature due
to changes in air pressure, and there was no way of accurately controlling this.

Once the sensor was implemented on the RPi, an experiment was devised to test
its level of accuracy. The robot was placed at fixed distances from the wall
and at each point 100 readings were recorded. The average response of this
experiment across the 1m range can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:usline}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{graphs/ultrasonic_response_1m_with_line_of_best_fit}
	\caption{Average ultrasound response}\label{fig:usline}
\end{figure}

It can be seen then that the response of the sensor is fairly reasonable producing a linear response with an offset of approximately \SI{18}{\milli\meter}. The values begin to deviate at greater distances, but the robot is unlikely to make measurements over significant distances. Indeed, in normal operation, considering the wide field of view of each sensor, it is very unlikely that no obstructions will be registered at the extremes of range, and it is unlikely that these values will be as useful as the shorter range ones.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{graphs/ZoomedDistance}
	\caption{Ultrasound response variance}\label{fig:usboxplots}
\end{figure}

In addition to plotting the average response, Figure~\ref{fig:usboxplots}
shows box plots at a subset of each point of measurement, the rest being
omitted for readability. It can be seen that the response is fairly
consistent at each data point, so a low variance can be safely assumed on
these sensors.

\section{Encoders}\label{elec/encoder}
Wheel encoders are required to measure the speed of each wheel
independently. This gives the system more control over its path
as well as allowing it to perform dead reckoning --- meaning an
approximate position can be maintained over time --- through wheel odometry.

\subsection{Design}\label{elec/encoder/design}
The motors selected had both incremental and absolute
encoders available which were suitable, but as only the wheel speed is needed and not the position,
the incremental rotary encoders were used. These were hall effect
encoders, which measure the changing magnetic field of magnets which
are attached to the motor shaft. It has two 6 pole magnets
which create 12 counts per revolution of the motor shaft, which, after
scaling for the gear ratio of 120:1, results in 1440 counts per
revolution of the robot wheel.

The encoders are quadrature encoders, which represent the speed and
direction of the wheels with two square waves, where the frequency
represents the speed and the leading wave indicates direction.

\subsection{Implementation}\label{elec/encoder/impl}

The encoder data was read into the RPi by an encoder class written in
Python. This worked by connecting callback methods to both the A and B
channel pins. This initialisation is shown in Listing~\ref{lst:enc_event_detect}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={encoder callback set-up},label={lst:enc_event_detect} , language=python]
GPIO.add_event_detect(self.pin$_$a, GPIO.BOTH, callback=self._callback_a)
\end{lstlisting}

This then either increments or decrements a count depending on the
direction, as shown in Listing~\ref{lst:enc_callback}. Note that
\verb|_callback_b()| is identical but with \verb|self._inc()| and
\verb|self._dec()| switched.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Encoder Callback Function},label={lst:enc_callback} , language=python]
def _callback_a(self, _):
        a, b = GPIO.input(self.pin_a), GPIO.input(self.pin_b)
        if a == b:
            self._inc()
        else:
            self._dec()
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Testing}\label{elec/encoder/test}
The encoders were first tested to ensure correct functionality using a test circuit and connecting the encoder outputs to an
oscilloscope. All the encoders were shown to function correctly
outputting square waves in both channels. Channel A led channel B
when the motor was moving forwards, and channel B led channel A when going backwards.

An example of the encoder output measured is shown in Figure~\ref{EncoderGraph} below. This shows the two square waves produced by the
two encoders outputs a quarter wavelength out of phase.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{graphs/EncoderGraph.jpg}
	\caption{Encoder output test waveforms}\label{EncoderGraph}

\end{figure}

This experiment allowed us to quickly confirm the correct functionality
of all 6 encoders, however did not allow us to test the accuracy. After
this, the motors were run at a low speed for several rotations while the
system counted pulses. This was not an accurate test of the encoders, as
the wheel could not be stopped at an exact integer multiple of rotations,
however did verify that the system was approximately outputting 1440
counts per revolution.

\section{IMU}\label{elec/imu}
The IMU consists of a three axis accelerometer and a three axis gyroscope
which can be used to measure both the linear acceleration and rotational
velocity of the robot. This can be integrated to obtain velocity and integrated again
to obtain displacement in order to track the robot's position over time, again by performing dead reckoning. It is worth noting
that the additional calculation here adds to the probability of error within the measurement. However, the
system can then perform sensor fusion on this data and the encoder
readings to get far more accurate results than is possible with either system
independently.

\subsection{Design}\label{elec/imu/design}
The IMU selected was the MPU-6050~\cite{MPU6050Datasheet}. It was the most accurate sensor of a
similar budget with regards to noise, cross axis sensitivity and non
linearity. Offset tolerance was also considered but this was less of a
concern as this can be compensated for, as long as the offset is not
so extreme as to limit the range. It was configured to operate in its
smallest range of values ($\pm\ang{250}s^{-1}$ and $\pm2g$~\cite{MPU6050Datasheet}).

The IMU was placed as close to the centre of the axis of the robot
as possible, as when it is far from the centre of rotation the centripetal
forces acting upon it can interfere and be measured as linear motion away
from the centre of the robot.

\subsection{Implementation}\label{elec/imu/impl}
The IMU selected uses the \isc{} protocol for data transmission, which
integrates well with the RPi as it has dedicated \isc{} GPIO pins and
existing libraries to facilitate communication.

It should be noted that, while this was the only \isc{} device currently
used, other devices with conflicting addresses can be handled as the IMU
allows the address to be changed through a data pin from 0x68 to 0x69.
This would most likely be used if the framework developed was being used
on another, more complicated system requiring several IMUs. This pin was
not connected to the RPi in this design as it was not yet required.

An \verb|i2c_object| class that used the ``smbus'' package was created to
simplify the communication over the \isc{} buses. These
were initialised with an \isc{} bus and an address, and
contained various methods for reading and writing to the \isc{} device,
such as \verb|read_word()|, shown in Code Listing~\ref{lst:i2c}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={I2C \texttt{read\_word()} function}, label={lst:i2c}]
def read_word(self, reg):
    """Read a word from the i2c_object at the register addresses reg and reg+1"""
    h = self.bus.read_byte_data(self.address, reg)
    l = self.bus.read_byte_data(self.address, reg + 1)
    value = (h << 8) + l
    return value
\end{lstlisting}

An \verb|IMU| class was then created to read the data from the IMU which
and an \verb|i2c_object| instance. Listing~\ref{lst:imu_init} shows
the constructor for the IMU class. Note that the \verb|write_byte()| call
is essential to enable the IMU transmissions.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={IMU Initialisation Function}, label={lst:imu_init}]
def __init__(self, address, rate, channel=1):
    self.address = address
    self.IMU_i2c = i2c.i2c_object(self.address, channel=channel)
    self.rate = rate
    self.IMU_i2c.write_byte(0x6B, 0x00) # turns imu on
    self.speed_vect = (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
\end{lstlisting}

As the IMU returns arbitrary values between -32768 and 32767~\cite{MPU6050Datasheet},
a constant was required to convert the results to meaningful values. These calculations are shown in Listing~\ref{lst:imu_units}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Calculation for IMU Value to SI unit Conversion Constants},label={lst:imu_units} , language=python]
GYRO_RANGE = 250  # deg/sec
GYRO_DIVISIONS = 32768  # 2 ^15
GYRO_UNITS = (GYRO_RANGE * math.pi * 2.0) / (GYRO_DIVISIONS * 360)  # rad/sec

ACC_RANGE = 2 * 9.81  # m/s^2
ACC_DIVISIONS = 32768  # 2 ^15
ACC_UNITS = ACC_RANGE / ACC_DIVISIONS  # m/s^2
\end{lstlisting}

The acceleration values can then be multiplied by the \verb|ACC_UNITS|
constant and the result is the acceleration in \si{\metre\per\second\squared}, and \verb|GYRO_UNITS|
can be used similarly to find the rotation in \si{\radian\per\second}, as is
shown in Listing~\ref{lst:read_funcs}.


\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Reading and Converting Raw IMU Values},label={lst:read_funcs} , language=python]
    def _read_gyro(self):
        x_rot_v = self.IMU_i2c.read_signed_word(0x43) * GYRO_UNITS
		    # ...
        return (x_rot_v, y_rot_v, z_rot_v)

    def _read_accel(self):
        x_a = self.IMU_i2c.read_signed_word(0x3b) * ACC_UNITS
		    # ...
        return (x_a, y_a, z_a)
\end{lstlisting}

The final step in reading the IMU results is to integrate the acceleration
data as to get the linear velocities. This makes use of the \verb|speed_vect| variable declared in the IMU constructor shown in Listing~\ref{lst:imu_init}. \verb|speed_vect| is incremented by the
acceleration multiplied by the IMU rate, as shown in~\ref{lst:imu_integration}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Integrating Linear Acceleration},label={lst:imu_integration} , language=python]

def get_speeds(self):
		    # ...
        accel_vect = self._read_accel()
        speed_vect = tuple([(1.0/self.rate) * accel_vect[i] + speed_vect[i] for i in range(len(accel_vect))])
        return speed_vect, gyro_speeds
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Testing}\label{elec/imu/test}
Initial work was performed with the IMU and an Arduino microcontroller
before the RPis were acquired. The IMU was connected up and various
movements were recorded. Python code was then written to interpret and
visualise the data as a moving frame. A frame from the output test video is shown in Figure \ref{fig:imu_py_test}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{imupyfig.png}
	\caption{IMU visualisation test frame}\label{fig:imu_py_test}

\end{figure}

Various tests were performed using this method testing both the gyroscope and the
accelerometer by moving and rotating the IMU. The tests showed reasonable results
indicating that the IMU was functioning properly and that the data was being interpreted
correctly. Exact measurements of accuracy could not be obtained, however, without a test
system for precisely controlling the acceleration and rotations.

\section{Sensor Placement}\label{mech/sensors}
The range sensors chosen were ultrasound sensors as these fit the
scalability and accuracy requirements of the range sensing. 
Mechanically these had to be mounted in a consistent manner on each 
robot to ensure that software results could be replicated between 
robots with minimal deviation from the standard code. The ultrasonic 
sensors chosen were HC-SR04~\cite{HCSR04datasheet}.

As can be seen from the datasheet, the sensors have a cone of 
detection of \ang{30}. This was the main consideration when designing 
the layout of the sensors at the front of the robot. Due to space 
restrictions on the front of robot, three sensors were used for an 
overall cone of detection of approximately \ang{90}. Mitigation of the dead-band was also considered resulting in the placement of
the sensor $\approx{\SI{30}{\mm}}$ from the edge of the robot chassis as shown in Figure~\ref{UltraSoundSensorDiagram}. 

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{diagrams/UltraSoundSensorDiagram.png}
	\caption{Ultrasound sensor layout}\label{UltraSoundSensorDiagram}

\end{figure}
 
The PCB could be designed with these measurements 
in mind and headers used to ensure the design 
was modular and sensors could be swapped out if needed. 

The IMU had to be placed in the centre/as 
close to the centre of the robot as possible. This was to ensure the 
IMU was as close to the centre rotation of the robot as possible, to 
obtain the most accurate readings possible. By placing the IMU correctly 
on the robot the need for regular calibration of the measurements is 
reduced. This heavily influenced the design of the PCB. 


\section{PCB}\label{elec/pcb}
As precise and consistent placement of components was required to ensure
homogeneity of the robots, a PCB was developed for the connection
and mounting of the parts. The following
describes the rationale and design decisions taken when carrying out the
3-iteration design process for designing the PCB. The final PCB design can
be found in the git repository (see Appendix~\ref{appendix/a}).

\subsection{Design}\label{elec/pcb/design}
The PCB required to contain the following components:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Raspberry Pi ribbon cable connector
  \item Three HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors
  \item MPU-6050 IMU
  \item Left and right encoder connectors
  \item Motor drive connectors
  \item Power connectors
  \item LEDs for debugging
\end{itemize}

with the following physical design constraints:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Central ultrasonic sensor at the centre of the robot in the x axis
  \item Other ultrasonic sensors symmetrical about the y axis
  \item IMU chip in centre of x and y axes
  \item Mounting holes for RPi and for mounting PCB to chassis
  \item Power connectors at fixed position relative to centre to ensure it
  connects to header on power distribution board
  \item Motor drive connectors also at fixed position relative to centre
\end{itemize}

When designing the PCB in
the first iteration, an attempt was made to use pins closest to the positions
of the components on the robot to achieve the neatest possible design, and minimise
crossing wires and vias. The IMU pins had to be connected to the two \isc{}
pins of the RPi and, similarly, the motor PWM pins were
connected to the two hardware PWM pins of the RPi. The remaining pin choices
were made arbitrarily as generic GPIO pins could be used for a variety of purposes.

Some minor changes were made in the connection of the generic GPIO pins in versions 2 and 3 of the PCB to minimise
via and path crossing. This can be seen in Table~\ref{table:pin_assignments}.

Note that the peculiar shape is to allow room for the motors and encoders.

\subsection{Testing}\label{elec/pcb/test}
After the components were soldered into place on the PCB, manual
continuity tests were performed with a multimeter to ensure that adjacent
pins had not been connected in the soldering process.

The PCB was then mounted and each module test was rerun to ensure that the
connections were all correct. This process exposed a flaw as one of the
ultrasonic sensors seemed to no longer work. After some investigation it
was noticed that the screws being used had slightly larger heads than the
screws used for mounting the test strip board and connected two
tracks of the PCB. A rubber washer was used as temporary fix and this was
corrected in the final PCB design.
