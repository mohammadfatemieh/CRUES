\chapter{Evaluation}\label{eval}
Based on the original objectives of the project (c.f. Section~\ref{introduction/objectives}), the project can be deemed as somewhat of a success. Five out of six of
the original ``Major'' objectives have been completed, as well as one of two of
the ``Optional'' objectives. In addition to this, it is believed that with a
small number of additional weeks, the remaining ``Major'' objective could
be completed. Given the project aimed to combine three engineering
disciplines and tackle complex problems simultaneously, a strong
effort has been made.
As detailed in various previous sections of the report, small setbacks in
various aspects of the project caused some of the latter stages of the project to be
uncompleted. This was especially true as many of the late-stage elements were sequential,
and the issues with the EKF resulted in large delays in the SLAM implementation.

Despite these setbacks, the management of the project was effective and the tasks were predominantly completed to schedule in the early to middle
stages of the project. Less management of the project was required in the latter
stages as objective related tasks became sequential, and those who were not
working on those tasks were assigned secondary objectives such as those
pertaining to the trade show or the report. Git was used effectively, with the
issues feature and protected merging used to ensure all members of the team were
working on a task and completion of tasks could be monitored by the project
manager.

A series of benchmark results have also been obtained and can be used by any future
continuations of the project to measure success. The
objectives which have been completed were also iterated upon multiple times to
complete for each of the robots to ensure the quality of the design.


\section{Mechanical}\label{eval/mech}
Mechanical aspects of the project have been completed to a
high standard as is demonstrated by the robustness of the robots when in
motion and the durability and modularity of the maze. This is largely due to the
decision to complete these tasks first with a higher priority and allow time for the
designs to be iterated upon throughout the project. The first robot was carefully
designed to ensure each component mechanically integrated well. This was further
iterated upon and improved between robots, leading to a final construction which was
consistent and reliable. Given not all objectives were met at the end of the project---and the electrical and software aspects were to be the focus---the decision taken in the
early stages to purchase a pre-built chassis as opposed to create a bespoke chassis
was justified, due to the time saved. This would have added unnecessary complication
in the beginning of the project which could have caused future
tasks to be delayed further.

The only issue which was encountered with the pre-built chassis was the
accompanying motors, which were identified as the possible cause of
issues throughout the electrical and software implementations. When used
for a reasonable period of time, the motors began to leak grease from
their plastic casing. This meant that the gearing system was not greased
and resulted in gears grinding and occasionally slipping. As the
encoders are on the motor shaft and not the drive shaft, this affected
the feedback from the encoders. It is thought that this contributed to
increased differences between robots at the end of the project and
increased difficulty in tuning the PID controller. If this issue
had been known from the start, the motors would have been either rotated
in testing to balance the degradation, or different motors would have
been used with a bespoke chassis, as finding motors to fit the pre-existing
chassis would not have been a suitable solution.

Aside from the robots, the other main mechanical component was the modular maze
testing environment. Although constructed by the mechanical workshop, a great deal of
effort was put into the design and subsequent iterations to obtain the best outcome
possible. The modular maze is a reusable ``SLAM playground'' and is a major
successful outcome of the project. Although not particularly transportable, the maze
is robust and durable and intended to last and can be used for future projects.

In addition, although not used in the final design, a great deal was learned from
using CAD to create designs of pegs which were intended for use in the maze. A number
of iterations of the design were created, which were improved both due to the feedback from the mechanical workshop as the specification changed and as the proficiency of using the CAD software increased. It was also worth noting that the CAD designed pegs were not flawed
because of the design, but due to limitations in the printing/construction process and as a result were unusable.
The mechanical portion of the project can therefore overall be deemed a success as
the individual components were made to a high standard of design and construction.

\section{Electrical}\label{eval/elec}
The electrical components of the project were completed to a high standard,
however some unforeseen complications caused the completion of these to be delayed. The pre-built power distribution board chosen had several advantages over a
custom built solution. Firstly, it was very easily integrated with the Polulu
chassis. Secondly, it saved the significant amount of time it would have taken
to build the drive circuit. Lastly, due to manufacturing restrictions on the PCB,
there was very little remaining space on the system's main PCB, so using a custom
build system would have required the design of a second PCB.

The range sensors used proved to be largely successful, with some caveats.
During the unit testing phase, the sensors performed well, giving consistent
readings that were accurate to within the tolerable uncertainty. During the SLAM testing,
they mostly measured accurate results, however, their limitations started to
become apparent. As the distance increased, the widening cone of detection caused some
erroneous data to be measured. This is assumed to be the cause of the corners
appearing to be rounded in the maze in Figure~\ref{fig:gmapping_output/rect}. Another issue with using the ultrasonic sensors is that the RPi used a time
shared OS, which meant that the readings from timing the pulse from the
ultrasonic sensor are sometimes inexact. This could be improved with the use of
a dedicated timing circuit.

Finally, as there were several range sensors on each
robot, taking one measurement sweep took a relatively long time. This is
especially the case when multiple robots are synchronising their sweeps to avoid
interference. This would have been mitigated if an infrared sensor had been used.
This would cost more, but it could be possible to mount the sensor on a servo
motor, and move it through \ang{180} sweeps as to not require more than one.
This would also remove the timing issue, as they generally return an analogue
voltage instead of a pulse time. Initially, this design concept was discounted due to the additional mechanical complexities of mounting the components and
cost, however without the time and budget restrictions, this solution would
likely improve the system's performance.

While using an IMU to supplement wheel odometry is a common solution, its
effectiveness in this project has not been evident. The IMU
returned reasonable results in testing, and the visualisation produced using
IMU data integrated with ROS shows promise. However, as the EKF was one of the last aspects of the project to be functional, results from its sensor fusion were not been obtained to
measure their accuracy.

Having multiple robots allowed an
iterative design process to be carried out, significantly improving the outcome
of the PCB. Connections and vias were altered following the first design to be
more easily integrable with the mechanical layout.

Time and care was taken to ensure the electrical design of the PCB and any other
connections between parts on the robot---such as the ribbon cable connection
between the PCB and the RPi---were robust and correct. This resulted
in a robot which is both electrically and mechanically sound and replicable
easily with time and parts. The robots which possess prototype parts, used in
interim stages of the iterative design process, remain functional and usable.
This demonstrates the careful selection and design of each of the parts.

The use of AA batteries throughout the middle stages of the project when the PID
controller was being tuned, resulted in a great deal of batteries being consumed.
This was due to the high current spikes which were being caused by motor stalls and
fewer batteries could have been used if this prolonged process had been foreseen. The
consistent current draw of the motors throughout this phase of testing should have
been monitored more closely and action to prevent this taken sooner.

Overall, the electrical portion of the project was carried out effectively but did
cause some delays which compounded later in the project. A number of
blocking tasks in the middle stages of the project required unforeseen parts to be
ordered such as ribbon cable and 40-pin IDC connectors which it was thought would
be found within the department. This was not the case as 40-pin ribbon cable and
connectors are used predominantly for Raspberry Pis, making them more expensive
and therefore, not a common order for the department. Hence, these parts had to be ordered in and resulted in the task blocking
others longer than expected as these were required for system testing. Towards the end of the project, an RPi was
shorted---the cause is unknown, despite investigations and testing---and ceased to function,
meaning time was lost to finding the cause of this issue.

\section{Software}\label{eval/soft}
The software architecture was well designed and thought-out making use of the
libraries and tools available. By using the ROS framework, the architecture was predominantly handled
and did not need to be managed further. ROS also provided
access to other tools and libraries such as ``differential-drive'', ``robot-
localization'' and ``gmapping''. It was thought that these libraries would be ``plug
and play'' with the modules created as part of the electrical sections. Despite
designing and implementing the electrical modules to integrate with these libraries,
problems were still encountered with integration.

The libraries were far more complex than first thought and were also not designed for
the configuration of sensors used in this project. Additional modules had to be
created as ``adapters'' with additional parameters between the libraries and the
originally created modules. Each of the libraries used therefore also had to be fully
understood, at a source code level, to construct the ``adapters'' and alter
the original modules. This took longer than expected, however did result in more in-depth knowledge of each of the component parts of the software. As the libraries were
designed for a variety of other sensors, mainly LIDAR instead of ultrasound, the
results obtained were not of as high quality as expected and this impacted the time
taken to tune parameters to achieve the best possible outcome. Although this was
somewhat achieved for SLAM, this left no time in the project to convert the SLAM map
to a world state which could then be used by an implemented AI to solve the maze
intelligently.

Furthermore, the combination of packages and demanding software 
made it very difficult to run all the code at once on the RPi. The 
ROS framework together with demanding functions like SLAM and 
Sensor Fusion proved to be too much for the limited memory and 
processing power, which made testing fully integrated systems 
extremely challenging.
