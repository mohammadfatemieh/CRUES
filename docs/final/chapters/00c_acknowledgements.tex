The authors would like to thank Dr John Levine for the opportunity to work on
such an interesting project and Dr Marilyn Lennon for her support throughout
the year. Thanks also to Steven Cartwright, whose constant help and advice with
the project cannot be overstated. We are indebted to Dr Mark Post, Dr James
Irvine, Dr Gordon Dobie, and others for providing guidance and expert
insight on various topics, and to George Cochrane, Keir Mitchell, and the
mechanical workshop team for their help in constructing the maze. The authors
would also like to thank friends and family who provided proof reading and
moral support. Finally, a heartfelt thanks to Don Eskridge, who divided or
united the team depending on the hour of the day.
